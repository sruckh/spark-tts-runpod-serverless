# Claude-Flow MCP Capabilities Clarification

## What Claude-Flow MCP CAN Do:

### ✅ Orchestration & Coordination
- **swarm_init**: Initialize swarm topologies (hierarchical, mesh, ring, star)
- **agent_spawn**: Create specialized agents with specific capabilities
- **task_orchestrate**: Create and queue tasks for execution
- **workflow_create/execute**: Define and trigger workflows

### ✅ Monitoring & Status
- **swarm_status**: Check swarm health and agent counts
- **task_status**: Monitor task progress
- **agent_metrics**: Get performance metrics
- **memory_usage**: Track memory and persistence

### ✅ Planning & Analysis
- **neural_patterns**: Analyze cognitive patterns
- **bottleneck_analyze**: Identify performance issues
- **token_usage**: Track token consumption
- **performance_report**: Generate performance reports

## What Claude-Flow MCP CANNOT Do:

### ❌ Direct Code Execution
- Cannot write or edit files directly
- Cannot execute actual implementation tasks
- Cannot run bash commands or system operations
- Cannot perform the actual work defined in tasks

### ❌ Sub-Agent Autonomy
- Spawned agents don't automatically execute tasks
- Tasks are queued but not self-executing
- No autonomous code generation or modification
- Requires Claude Code tools for actual implementation

## The Reality:

**Claude-Flow MCP is a COORDINATION layer, not an EXECUTION layer.**

### Correct Workflow:
1. Use claude-flow to **plan and organize** work
2. Use Claude Code tools to **execute** the work:
   - Read/Write/Edit files
   - Bash commands
   - Grep/Glob searches
   - Task tool for sub-agents (limited by model)

### Why SPARC Execution Failed:
- SPARC tries to spawn new Claude instances
- Running as root prevents --dangerously-skip-permissions
- Even if it worked, it would spawn a separate Claude session
- That session wouldn't have context of current work

## Practical Usage:

### Good Use Cases:
```bash
# Planning and organization
npx claude-flow sparc modes  # List available modes
npx claude-flow hooks  # Automation hooks

# Memory and persistence
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage  # Store/retrieve context
```

### Not Useful For:
```bash
# These create structure but don't execute
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn  # Creates agent record only
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate  # Queues task only
```

## Conclusion:

Claude-Flow MCP tools are excellent for:
- **Organizing** complex projects
- **Tracking** progress and metrics
- **Planning** multi-step workflows
- **Storing** memory and context

But actual implementation must use:
- **Claude Code native tools** (Read, Write, Edit, Bash)
- **Direct implementation** by the primary Claude instance
- **Manual execution** of planned tasks

The "sub-agents" created by claude-flow are organizational constructs, not autonomous workers. The actual work must be done by Claude Code using its native tools.
