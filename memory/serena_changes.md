# Serena Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the Spark-TTS project during the Serena workflow execution. These changes were made to complete the RunPod serverless migration and repackaging as specified in the project GOALS.md.

## Files Modified/Added

### Core Serverless Implementation
1. **handler.py** - Main serverless handler implementing all CLI parameters from cli.inference
2. **s3_utils.py** - S3 integration with Backblaze B2 support using AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
3. **setup_volume.py** - Volume setup and dependency installation on /runpod-volume

### Documentation
1. **docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Complete API documentation with all endpoint parameters
2. **docs/GOALS_VALIDATION_REPORT.md** - Validation report confirming all 23 goals met
3. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Implementation completion confirmation

### Configuration
1. **Dockerfile** - Minimal container build for GitHub Actions
2. **requirements_runtime.txt** - Runtime dependencies for serverless environment
3. **.github/workflows/docker-build.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow for DockerHub deployment

### Project Management
1. **TASKS.md** - Updated task tracking showing completion
2. **JOURNAL.md** - Engineering journal entry documenting completion
3. **GOALS.md** - Project goals file (referenced but not modified)

## Key Implementation Details

### Serverless Architecture
- Created minimal container build that works with GitHub Actions
- Implemented network volume support at /runpod-volume for dependencies and models
- Added lazy loading prohibition for serverless environment
- Configured Python 3.11 environment with specified PyTorch and Flash Attention versions

### S3 Integration
- Enhanced S3Handler with AWS_ENDPOINT_URL support for Backblaze B2
- Implemented pre-signed URLs for file operations
- Organized voice reference audio in voices/ sub-directory
- Configured output storage in output/ sub-directory

### API Implementation
- All CLI parameters from cli.inference script supported in serverless API
- Base64 file handling prohibited (using direct file names/URLs)
- Environmental variables used for all configurable inputs
- Added WhisperX for word-level timings
- Integrated ASS subtitle generation with Python ass module

### Dependency Management
- Created virtual environment on /runpod-volume
- Installed specified versions of PyTorch and Flash Attention
- Setup automatic dependency installation on volume mount
- Organized all data in SparkTTS-serverless sub-directory on volume

## Validation
All 23 goals from GOALS.md have been successfully implemented and validated:
- ✅ Simple repackaging without changing core source code
- ✅ Minimal container that builds easily on GitHub
- ✅ Repository updated to sruckh/spark-tts-runpod-serverless
- ✅ All CLI parameters supported in API endpoint
- ✅ DockerHub deployment configured with secrets
- ✅ Network volume implementation for dependencies/models
- ✅ S3 storage for voice references and output
- ✅ Pre-signed URLs for file operations
- ✅ Environmental variables for configuration
- ✅ WhisperX and ASS subtitle support
- ✅ No lazy loading in serverless environment
- ✅ Python 3.11 environment
- ✅ Specified PyTorch and Flash Attention versions
- ✅ Sub-agent rule compliance
- ✅ Code linting with pylint, flake8, and black

The project is now production-ready for RunPod Serverless deployment.
